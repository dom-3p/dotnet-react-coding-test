# 3P Learning - Full Stack Coding Test - Junior Developer
3P learning's full-stack coding test for dot net c# and react developers

## Background

For this task you need to build a web application which is a source code repository management tool that will allow a user to keep a list of source code repositories. The reason for this is so that they can in future group repositories by development teams to understand which team owns which part of the overall codebase.

You will be building both the backend api using .Net / C#, as well as the front-end interface using React. As a rough time line you should spend between 1 and 2 hours to complete the build. You should complete this at least 24 hours before your interview and send the link to the forked repository (instructions below) to your 3P Learning contact.

You do not need to use a database for this task, in-memory data which is destroyed every time the application is stopped is perfectly acceptable.

## Requirements

The repository management tool that you are building should have the following features:
1. A list showing all source code repositories
2. The ability to create a new repository record
3. The ability to remove an existing  repository record
4. The ability to update an existing repository record


## Instructions

1. Create a new code repository on Github under your Github account. You can create a free Github account if you don't have one already.
2. In your code repository create a folder called `api` and create a new dotnet web api project in that folder
3. Create another folder called `ui` and create a new react project in that folder
4. Create the code needed to meet the requirements above, plus anything you feel is needed for the web application
5. Push the code to your Github repository and send a link to your code to your 3P contact
