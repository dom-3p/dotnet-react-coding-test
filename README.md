# dotnet-react-coding-test
3P learning's full-stack coding test for dot net c# and react developers

## Background

For this task you need to build a repository management tool that will allow a user to keep track of source code repositories via a central web interface. You will be building both the backend api using .Net / C#, as well as the front-end interface using React. As a rough time line you should spend between 1 and 2 hours to complete the build. You should complete this at least 24 hours before your interview and send the link to the forked repository (instructions below) to your 3P Learning contact.
